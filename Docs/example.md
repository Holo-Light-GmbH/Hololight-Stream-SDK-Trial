HelloISAR is a simple example which displays a 3D ISAR logo within the scene. The example allows the user to view the object and move around the environment; however does not contain any input interaction.

> :warning: This example has a dependency upon MRTK therefore ISAR Core MRTK Extension package must be installed

The following steps should be followed to open and run the example:
- Open the directory `HelloISAR`, contained in this repo, with Unity
- When opening the project for the first time, a package reference warning may appear. Click "Continue" and let the project load
