# Example

The example below can be used as a reference or template for a Hololight Stream capable project.

## HelloStream

HelloStream is a simple example which displays the Hololight Stream logo within the scene. The example allows the user to view the object and move around the environment; however does not contain any input interaction.

> :warning: This example has a dependency upon MRTK therefore Hololight Stream MRTK Extension package is installed

The following steps should be followed to open and run the example:

- Open the directory `HelloStream`, contained in this repo, with Unity
- When opening the project for the first time, a package reference warning may appear. Click "Continue" and let the project load
- Follow the MRTK installation step described in the [MRTK First Installation](mrtk2_extension.md#first-installation)
- Open and run the scene `Assets/Example/HelloStream.unity`
